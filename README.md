My Master's Thesis titled "Non-proportional hazards models"

The thesis presents Cox's proportional hazards model and non-proportional hazards models together with the example of practical application of Cox's proportional hazards model, Cox's model with time-dependent coefficients, proportional odds model and the additive hazards model. 

The theoretical part presents in particular various methods estimating of parameters of models described. The practical part was conducted in R package. It is preceded by the theoretical description of selected tools and methods.
